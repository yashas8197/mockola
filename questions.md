# Instructions for OLA

1. Define all the endpoints in `index.js` file
2. Every endpoint must have a function above it which does the operations
3. Fork this Repl and write your code to define the endpoints in the index.js file.
4. You need to use functions to write the code of each endpoint.
5. Ensure that your variables and endpoints are named properly.
6. Run the endpoints and check that you are getting the expected output before submitting.
7. Revise your work before you submit as you will only be able to fill the Submission Form once.
